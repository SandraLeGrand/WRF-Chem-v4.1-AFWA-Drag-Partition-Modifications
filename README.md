# WRF-Chem-v4.1-AFWA-Drag-Partition-Modifications

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/396943079.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/396943079)

This repository contains the four modified WRF-Chem v4.1 files required to incorporate version 1.0 of the albedo-based drag partition parameterization originally developed by Chappell and Webb (2016) into the AFWA dust emission module. 

Though we used WRF-Chem v4.1 in this implementation example, the process should be relatively consistent for later WRF-Chem versions (currently on v4.4 at the time of publication). We recommend users planning to use the WRF-Chem/GOCART dust transport capability work with WRF-Chem v4.1 or later due to a critical bug fix in the GOCART deposition module.

WRF-Chem v4.1 baseline source code and run instructions are available for download at https://github.com/wrf-model/WRF/releases/tag/v4.1.

To implement these changes, copy the .F files within each subfolder listed below from this repository to the corresponding subfolder within the main WRF-Chem Directory and recompile. Note that because these steps include a change to the registry, you will need to do a full clean of WRF-Chem in order for the new code to compile correctly.

Code included in this repository:

-registry.chem: file to add namelist variables

-chem_driver.F: passes uns* data to the AFWA dust emission module

-emissions_driver.F: passes uns* data to the AFWA dust emission module

-module_gocart_dust_afwa.F: AFWA dust emission module with drag partition code modifications

Please refer to the technical report by Michaels et al. (2022; ERDC/CRREL TR-22-2) for detailed code descriptions, guidance on how to prepare the required input data, and instructions model runtime instructions.
